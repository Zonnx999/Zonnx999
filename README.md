- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zonnx999
nice to meet you ;)

Interests:
- Game Dev (Unity, Godot)
- Still searching for more...

Python is my Main Language

<!---
- 🌱 I learned python for my first language in 2020.. (during quarantine) and I got a lot of interest in programming afterwards.
I Learned...
1) python 3.xx
2) swift
3) HTML / CSS
4) javascript (a little)
5) c# (a little)
6) R lang (at school, for data science)
7) rust (a little)

- now I'm surely confident about basic structures of a programming language
- as you can see, yes, I tried to build an website... but I'm interested in game devs more (at least for now)

- 📫 How to reach me ...
1) contact -> eric.myoung@icloud.com (still there are very low chance of someone to actually contact me..)
